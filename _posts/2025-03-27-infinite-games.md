Communication is an infinite game.

Consciousness is a peculiar form of communication that is distinguished by its ability to mediate the establishment of communication between different computational processes that share resources but that otherwise may have significantly different internal structure.

In order to communicate deliberately rather than merely be a machinic broadcaster of a signal, B must model itself. It must be able to decode it own output at least somewhat. Otherwise communication would be at best a shot in the dark. Before A and B have established communication, they must have methods for parsing and decoding their outputs that are independent of one another. They must model themselves, with the help of resources that (from the perspective of the other) are proper to them.

To parse `data_B`, then A must 


From an intuitive point of view, such an ability requires consciousness to concurrently form and match simulations of the recipient of its attention; that is, for process A to attend consciously to process B, A must open a channel of communication to a form of input from B whose raw data are observable but whose meaning is unkown. In order to process this data, A must already implicitly simulate B; that is, to the extent that A can parse B's data at all, A must *already* contain processes that can invert B's processessing and therefore must resemble it. However, in the case of interest, namely establishing novel contact, such preliminary observations will leave large stretches of B's data indecipherable. Thus, the simulations of the inverse data generating process must be refined, and it may be that more (modularly) independent simulations must be formed inside of A in order to most thoroughly decipher B's data. It can also happen that, while A initially allocates only a certain amount of computational resources to modeling B, the errors in such a process necessitate the allocation of new resources.
