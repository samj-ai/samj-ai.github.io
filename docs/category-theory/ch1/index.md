# Chapter 1: Basic Definitions

Let's verify that our math rendering is working:

A category $\mathcal{C}$ consists of:
* A collection of objects
* For any objects $A$ and $B$, a collection of morphisms 
$\text{Hom}_\mathcal{C}(A,B)$
* For each object $A$, an identity morphism $1_A: A \to A$
* A composition operation satisfying the associativity and identity laws
